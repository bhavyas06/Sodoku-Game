# Sudoku Game
This project provides a fully functional Sudoku game which contains a Sudoku Generator and a Sudoku Solver. The generator can create random Sudoku grids with different difficulty modes and the once the game starts the user can solve the game by providing the row number, column number and the digit. The solver efficiently solves the any grid and provides logic to determine whether the inputs or valid or not. The game also gives the user the option to quit the game or see the solution at any point. All the functions are designed with performance and scalability in mind, suitable for small applications or as part of a larger systems or projects.
